# Release Management

## Version Bumping
When preparing a release:

1. **Never run `npm publish` manually** - This is handled by GitHub Actions
2. **Update version** in `package.json` using semantic versioning:
   - **Patch** (0.1.2 → 0.1.3): Bug fixes, documentation updates
   - **Minor** (0.1.2 → 0.2.0): New features, backward compatible
   - **Major** (0.1.2 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with release notes:
   - What's new
   - Bug fixes
   - Breaking changes (if any)
   - Migration notes

## Release Process
1. **Prepare Release Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v0.1.3
   ```

2. **Update Version & Changelog**:
   - Bump version in `package.json`
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` to ensure everything works

3. **Create Release PR**:
   - Title: "Release v0.1.3"
   - Include changelog in PR description
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

4. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - After PR is merged, create a GitHub release
   - Tag format: `v0.1.3`
   - Include changelog in release notes
   - This triggers automatic NPM publishing

## Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass with coverage
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] Version number follows semver
- [ ] No breaking changes without major version bump
- [ ] CI pipeline passes on main branch

## Automated Publishing
The GitHub Actions workflow handles:
- Building the package
- Running final tests
- Publishing to NPM registry
- Creating distribution files

**Never bypass this process** - it ensures consistency and proper CI validation.
