# Testing Standards

## Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum 80%** coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- Use `npm run test:coverage` to run tests with coverage reporting
- Coverage reports available in `coverage/` directory

## Test Structure
- Follow the existing test patterns in `src/__tests__/`
- Use Vitest with globals enabled
- Test database setup in `src/test-utils/vitest.setup.ts`

## Database Testing
- Use `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable for test database
- Tests should be isolated and not affect each other
- Clean up test data after each test

## Test Naming
- Describe what the test does: `should create task with valid data`
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for setup/cleanup

## Mock Patterns
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Use Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities
- Avoid mocking internal functions unless necessary

## Test Data
- Create meaningful test data that represents real usage
- Use factories or builders for complex test objects
- Keep test data minimal but realistic
