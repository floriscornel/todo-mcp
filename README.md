A powerful, multi-mode Todo list manager that works everywhere - from Claude Desktop to web applications to command-line automation. Organize your tasks across different projects with priorities and never lose track of what needs to be done!


## ‚ú® Features

- üìù **Simple Task Management** - Create, complete, and archive tasks
- üìÇ **Project Organization** - Separate tasks by lists (perfect for different codebases/projects)
- üéØ **Priority System** - Low, Medium, High, and Urgent priorities
- üïí **Time Tracking** - Automatic timestamps for creation, completion, and archiving
- üîç **Smart Sorting** - Tasks sorted by priority and age automatically
- üíæ **Persistent Storage** - Uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage

## üåê Multiple Usage Modes

Todo MCP now supports **four different modes** to fit any workflow:

### ü§ñ **MCP Mode: [Standard Input/Output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#streamable-http)** (Default)
Traditional Model Context Protocol for Claude Desktop and MCP-compatible AI assistants. This starts a MCP server using the standard input/output (stdio) transport which is the default transport for MCP servers.

### üåê **MCP Mode: [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#streamable-http)** 
Streaming HTTP server is the replacement of SSE MCP mode. It uses HTTP communication to connect your agent to the MCP server, meaning they can be on different machines. It also allows one MCP server to be used by multiple agents simultaneously.

### üìö **OpenAPI Mode**
Auto-generated REST API with interactive Swagger UI documentation. This allows tools that do not support MCP such as [open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) to access the MCP server. By accessing the OpenAPI documentation, and LLM with fetch capabilities can understand how to use the MCP server even if it does not support MCP.

### ‚ö° **CLI Mode**
Direct command-line tool execution for automation and scripting. This is useful for automation and scripting. You can manually perform tasks using the CLI.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Database (Choose One)

#### Option A: DBngin (Recommended for Mac Users) üçé
1. Download [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/) - A simple database manager for Mac
2. Install and open DBngin
3. Click "+" and select PostgreSQL
4. Start the PostgreSQL server
5. Create two databases:
   - `todo_mcp` (for your tasks)
   - `todo_mcp_test` (for testing)

#### Option B: Docker Compose (Cross-Platform) üê≥
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: todo_mcp
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

2. Run: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Create test database: `docker exec -it <container_name> createdb -U postgres todo_mcp_test`

### Step 2: Choose Your Integration Mode

#### ü§ñ Claude Desktop (MCP stdio Mode)

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP settings to use the traditional stdio transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todo-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@floriscornel/todo-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/todo_mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### üåê Web Application (MCP HTTP Mode)

Start the streamable HTTP server for multi-agent access:
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @floriscornel/todo-mcp

# Start HTTP server
todo-mcp --transport http --port 3001

# Or using npx
npx @floriscornel/todo-mcp --transport http --port 3001
```

Your todo API is now available at `http://localhost:3001`!

#### üìö API Development (OpenAPI Mode)

Start with interactive documentation:
```bash
# Start OpenAPI server with Swagger UI
todo-mcp --transport openapi --port 3002

# Or using npx
npx @floriscornel/todo-mcp --transport openapi --port 3002
```

Visit `http://localhost:3002/ui` for interactive API documentation!

#### ‚ö° Command Line (CLI Mode)

Use directly from the command line:
```bash
# List all your todo lists
todo-mcp --transport cli --tool getLists

# Get tasks from a specific list
todo-mcp --transport cli --tool getTasks --parameters '{"list":"work"}'

# Create a new task
todo-mcp --transport cli --tool createTask --parameters '{"list":"work","name":"Fix login bug","priority":"high"}'

# List all available tools
todo-mcp --transport cli --list
```

### Step 3: Start Using! üéâ

**Claude Desktop users** (using stdio transport) can ask things like:
- "Create a new list called 'Frontend Project'"
- "Add a task to fix the login bug with high priority"
- "Show me all my urgent tasks"
- "Complete the task about updating dependencies"

**Web developers** (using HTTP transport) can make HTTP requests:
```bash
# Get all lists
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# MCP over HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"getLists"},"id":1}'
```

**API developers** can explore the interactive docs at `http://localhost:3002/ui` and use endpoints like:
```bash
# Get all lists via REST API
curl http://localhost:3002/api/get-lists

# Create a task via REST API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/create-task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"list":"work","name":"New task","priority":"medium"}'
```

## üí° Real-World Examples

### üîÑ **Code Review Workflow**
```
You: "I'm reviewing this PR and found several issues. Can you help me track them?"

Claude: "I'll help you create tasks for the issues you found. First, let me create a list for this PR."

You: "Create a list called 'PR-123 Review Issues'"

Claude: *Creates the list*

You: "Add these tasks:
- Fix memory leak in UserService (high priority)
- Add error handling for API calls (medium)
- Update outdated dependencies (low)
- Add unit tests for new features (high)"

Claude: *Creates all tasks with appropriate priorities*

You: "Show me the high priority items first"
```

### üêõ **Bug Triage Session**
```
You: "I just got 5 bug reports from users. Help me organize them by priority."

Claude: "Let me create a 'Bug Reports - Sprint 24' list and add these issues. What are the bugs?"

You: "Login fails on mobile Safari, checkout process crashes, slow page load, typo in footer, and dark mode toggle broken"

Claude: *Creates tasks and asks about severity*

Claude: "I've added these. The login and checkout issues sound urgent - should I mark them as high priority?"

You: "Yes, and show me all urgent tasks across all my lists so I can plan my day"
```

### üöÄ **Feature Development Planning**
```
You: "I'm starting work on a new dashboard feature. Help me break it down into tasks."

Claude: "Great! Let me create a 'Dashboard Feature' list. What components do you need to build?"

You: "I need to design the layout, create API endpoints, build the frontend components, write tests, and update documentation"

Claude: *Creates structured tasks*

Claude: "I've created tasks for each component. Should I mark the API endpoints as high priority since the frontend depends on them?"

You: "Perfect! Also add a task to review the design with the team before I start coding"
```

### üìö **Learning & Research Tracking**
```
You: "I'm learning React Native. Can you help me track my progress?"

Claude: "I'll create a 'React Native Learning' list. What topics do you want to cover?"

You: "Navigation, state management, API integration, testing, and deployment"

Claude: *Creates learning tasks*

You: "I just finished the navigation tutorial. Mark that as complete and show me what's next"

Claude: "Great progress! Next up is state management. I can also help you find resources for that topic."
```

### üîß **Refactoring Project**
```
You: "I need to refactor this legacy codebase. There's so much to do, I don't know where to start."

Claude: "Let's break it down systematically. I'll create a 'Legacy Refactor' list. What are the main areas that need work?"

You: "Database queries are slow, no error handling, outdated dependencies, no tests, and the UI is a mess"

Claude: *Creates organized tasks with priorities*

Claude: "I've prioritized database performance and error handling as urgent since they affect users directly. Want me to help you tackle the database issues first?"
```

### üéØ **Daily Standup Preparation**
```
You: "What did I work on yesterday and what should I focus on today?"

Claude: "Let me check your completed tasks from yesterday and show you today's priorities."

*Shows completed tasks and upcoming high-priority items*

Claude: "Yesterday you completed the user authentication fix and API documentation. Today's urgent tasks are the payment gateway integration and the mobile responsive fixes."

You: "Perfect! Add a new task to review the payment gateway with the security team before deploying"
```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Sprint Planning**
```
You: "Help me plan this 2-week sprint. I have tasks scattered across different lists."

Claude: "I'll show you all your tasks grouped by priority. Which lists should I include in the sprint planning?"

You: "Include 'Frontend Bugs', 'API Development', and 'User Stories - Q4'"

Claude: *Aggregates and prioritizes tasks*

Claude: "Here are your urgent and high-priority tasks. Based on your usual velocity, I'd recommend focusing on these 8 tasks for the sprint. Should I create a 'Sprint 12' list to track them?"
```

### üîç **Code Investigation**
```
You: "This function is behaving weirdly. Help me track what I need to investigate."

Claude: "I'll create an 'Investigation - UserAuth Bug' list. What symptoms are you seeing?"

You: "Users can't log in on weekends, but weekdays work fine. It's bizarre."

Claude: "That is strange! Let me add investigation tasks:
- Check server logs for weekend patterns
- Review cron jobs and scheduled tasks  
- Test with different user accounts
- Check database connection pooling
- Review load balancer configuration"

You: "Great breakdown! I just checked the logs - mark that complete and add a task to check if our SSL certificate renewal happens on weekends"
```

## üé® **IDE Integration Benefits**

### **Claude Desktop**
- **Persistent Context**: Your tasks persist across conversations
- **Natural Language**: "Show me what I was working on last week"
- **Smart Prioritization**: Claude can help reprioritize based on deadlines

### **VS Code / Cursor**
- **Code-Aware Tasks**: "Add a task to refactor this function" (while viewing code)
- **Context Switching**: Quickly switch between coding and task management
- **Inline Planning**: Plan refactoring while reviewing code

### **Cross-Session Continuity**
- **Pick Up Where You Left Off**: "What was I working on before the meeting?"
- **Team Handoffs**: "Show the new developer what needs to be done on this feature"
- **Progress Tracking**: "How much of the authentication system is complete?"

## üß™ Testing MCP Tools Directly

The todo-mcp includes an `ExtendedMcpServer` class that makes it easy to test MCP tools directly without setting up transports. This is perfect for:

- **Unit Testing** - Test individual tools in isolation
- **Integration Testing** - Test workflows with multiple tool calls  
- **Development & Debugging** - Explore tool behavior during development
- **API Exploration** - Programmatically discover tool capabilities

### Quick Example

```typescript
import { ExtendedMcpServer } from "@floriscornel/todo-mcp/utils";
import { loadTodoService } from "@floriscornel/todo-mcp/service";
import { initializeDatabase } from "@floriscornel/todo-mcp/db";

// Initialize
await initializeDatabase();
const server = new ExtendedMcpServer({ name: "test", version: "1.0.0" });
await loadTodoService(server);

// Call tools directly
const result = await server.callTool("createList", {
  name: "My Test List",
  description: "Created via direct tool call"
});

// Batch operations
const results = await server.callTools([
  { tool: "getLists", parameters: { random_string: "test" } },
  { tool: "createTask", parameters: { list: "My Test List", name: "Test task" } }
]);

// Tool introspection
const toolNames = server.getToolNames(); // ["getLists", "createList", ...]
const toolInfo = server.getToolInfo("createTask"); // Full tool metadata
const hasTools = server.hasTool("getTasks"); // true
```

### Available Testing Methods

| Method | Purpose | 
|--------|---------|
| `callTool(name, params)` | Execute a single tool with parameters |
| `callTools(calls)` | Execute multiple tools in sequence |
| `getToolNames()` | List all available tool names |
| `getToolInfo(name)` | Get detailed tool information |
| `hasTool(name)` | Check if a tool exists |
| `getToolsMetadata()` | Get metadata for all tools |

### Example Script

Check out the complete example at [`examples/test-tools-directly.ts`](examples/test-tools-directly.ts) which demonstrates:

- Tool discovery and introspection
- Creating lists and tasks
- Error handling and validation
- Batch operations
- Integration testing patterns

This makes the todo-mcp project highly testable and provides a solid foundation for building reliable MCP-based applications.

## üìñ How It Works

### Lists
Think of lists as different projects or categories:
- **Frontend Repo** - Tasks for your React app
- **Backend API** - Server-side todos
- **Personal** - Non-work related tasks

### Tasks
Each task has:
- **Name** (5-120 characters) - Keep it concise and actionable
- **Description** (optional, up to 500 characters) - Add details if needed
- **Priority** - Low ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí High ‚Üí Urgent
- **Timestamps** - When created, completed, or archived

### Smart Organization
- Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (urgent first) and age
- Completed tasks are kept for reference but don't clutter your active list
- Archive tasks when they're no longer relevant

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

The MCP provides these tools for Claude:

- `getLists()` - Show all your project lists
- `createList(name, description?)` - Create a new project list
- `getTasks(list, includeCompleted?)` - Get tasks from a specific list
- `createTask(list, name, description?, priority?)` - Add a new task
- `completeTask(taskId)` - Mark a task as done
- `archiveTask(taskId)` - Archive a task (removes from active view)
